# AI-Generated Fix for User-Space Crash
# Program: user_crash
# Root Cause: Division by zero.
# Trap Type: Trap 0 (Divide Error) is an exception generated by the CPU when an attempt is made to divide by zero or when the quotient of an integer division is too large to fit in the destination register. In this case, the program explicitly tries to divide by 0.
# Faulty Line: user_crash.c:14

To fix this, ensure that the divisor 'y' is never zero before performing the division. A simple fix would be to change the initialization of 'y' to a non-zero value, or add a check before the division.user_crash.c:9: Change 'int y = 0;' to 'int y = 1;' (or any other non-zero value).
